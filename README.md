# TaweLib-Reborn
A recreation of the CS-230 Software Engineering software product specifically, the library system with a single person login system. Hopefully with better functionality than the original.

# Update
Tawe-Lib Reborn has all the functionality that satisfies the specification (with some unnecessary stuff like edit users) minus the 'extra' feature and user statistics. Any pushes to this repository from this day onwards will be refactoring of code and possibly the removal of the Property class.
